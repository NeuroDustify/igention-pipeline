# scripts/__init__.py
# This file makes the 'scripts' directory a Python package.

# You can optionally import specific functions or classes here
# if you want them to be directly accessible when importing the package.
# For example:
# from .generate_suburb_data import main_menu
# from .some_other_script import another_function

# For now, an empty file is enough to define the package.
